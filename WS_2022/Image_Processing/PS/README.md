On this page you will find the assignments for the Image Processing PS.



### News / Important notes

- Update: Group size increased to max. 4 (Oct. 3, 2022)
- Attendance in the PS is mandatory



### Groups

All assignments have to be solved in **groups of max. 4**. Once you found your group members, one of the members should drop me an [email}(dsoellinger@cs.sbg.ac.at) stateing the members of his/her group.

**Deadline**: Oct. 10, 2022



### Grading

Grading is based on the assignments. For a positive grade, you need to have more than 50% of all possible points. The grades are then distributed linearly up to the max. number of achievable points (excluding the bonus points).

*All* group members will get the same grade, except for cases where it is obvious that group members did not participate to the required extent.



### Submission

Assignments have to be uploaded in [Blackboard](https://elearn.sbg.ac.at/ultra) until specified deadline. More details will be provided once the groups have been defined.

Each exercise sheet needs to be handed-in in the form of a Jupyter notebook. Hand in the notebook, even if you do not complete all exercises.
The filename of the notebook needs to have the following format: `ExSheet_X.ipynb` or `ExSheet_X.zip` (depending on whether additional resources (are required so that I can run your code).
